# About the project
This project predicts the price of houses in Perth, Australia based on various characteristics of the house such as ***land area, floor area, number of rooms, age, location, distance to central business district,...***
Additionally, it also analyses some economic factors such as ***interest rate, population growth, unemployment*** and ***inflation*** to see the effect of those factors on the house prices.
# About the dataset
We use the dataset that was scraped by Muhammad S. Zainal from http://house.speakingsame.com/. The dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syuzai/perth-house-prices)
# Implementation progress
The progress is conducted by the following 4 steps:
- **Step 1**: *Data preprocessing*. This step includes importing data, cleaning data and reformating data.
- **Step 2**: *Data visualization and analysis*. In this step, we draw some plot such as *3D scatterplot, boxplot, histogram, choropleth map* to gain some insight from the data.
- **Step 3**: *Build the prediction model*, using Artificial Neural Network.
- **Step 4**: *Evaluating model*, using distribution plot and record performance metrics.
